# FBLA Web Dev

Using React, Gatsby, and Netlify.

### Developing
1. Clone the repo
2. `$ npm install` the dependencies
3. `$ npm start` _or_ `$ gatsby develop` to run a dev server with HMR.

### Building
Commits are built by netlify automatically.
However, a local production build can be created with `$ gatsby build`.
